# Database Manager

The Database Manager extension lets you conveniently manage your Concrete CMS database directly from the dashboard, offering core features similar to phpMyAdmin or Adminerâ€”but fully integrated and simplified for ease of use. You can view and sort tables, as well as edit, add, and delete individual entries, making it perfect for small-scale operations and quick changes. A flexible permission system allows you to control access for different users via Concrete CMS task permissions, including rights to access the manager, insert, edit, or delete rows. If the extension gains popularity in the Marketplace, additional features such as table deletion, SQL execution, import/export, and structure editing will follow. For everyday tasks, however, this tool is already the perfect solution.
