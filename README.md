With the Database Manager extension, you are able to conveniently edit the database stored in concrete5 within your dashboard. Just like the big brother phpMyAdmin or Adminer just slightly reduced in functionality but fully integrated.

With this extension you can currently view and sort tables, as well as edit, add and delete entries. This provides you with a perfect base to quickly and easily view or change a few table entries.

Thanks to a sophisticated authorization system, you can also use the extension with several users in various ways. In the concrete5 task authorizations you can determine who is allowed to do something and who is not allowed to do certain things.

The following permissions can be set:
- Permission to access the database manager
- Permission to delete rows
- Permission to edit rows
- Permission to insert rows

If there is a high demand for this extension in the Marketplace I will implement more features step by step like e.g. delete tables; import/export; execute suitable SQL code; edit data structure and much more.

For smaller basic operations, however, this extension is already the ideal application!
